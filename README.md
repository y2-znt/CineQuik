## Skills Gained 📚

This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge and skills in React, specifically:

- **React Hooks:** Use of useState, useEffect, and useParams to manage state, effects, and parameters in my components.
- **Library Documentation:** Learning to use and refer to third-party library documentation such as React-Youtube and Swiper to integrate specific functionalities.

This experience not only helped me build this application but also enhanced my understanding and confidence in using these advanced React features and tools.
